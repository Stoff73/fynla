## Session 65b (23 April late-afternoon) — CSP / Revolut / .env cascade

### Completed

- [x] **Removed HSTS + CSP + Permissions-Policy `Header set` from both `.htaccess` templates** (`deploy/csjones-fynla/.htaccess`, `deploy/fynla-org/.htaccess`). Apache's `Header set` was overwriting `SecurityHeaders` middleware's richer CSP and blocking Revolut widget on dev. Commit `f0770bb`.
- [x] **Uploaded new csjones `.htaccess` to dev server**, cleared Laravel caches.
- [x] **Fixed dotenv syntax on server `.env` line 62** — `ADMIN_EMAILS` now quoted (was unquoted comma-separated value with whitespace, invalid dotenv syntax that was hidden by config cache until `config:clear` exposed it). Backup at `.env.backup-2026-04-23-csp-fix`.
- [x] **Pinned `VITE_REVOLUT_SANDBOX=true` + `VITE_REVOLUT_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_D2JdE2srRipv0jdHerivLw1hMoWSrjqDa4lEozJxTwchuG04`** into `deploy/csjones-fynla/build.sh`. Builds now reproducible regardless of builder's local `.env`. Commits `921bb3d` + follow-up.
- [x] **Rebuilt + uploaded** new `public/build/`. New `CheckoutPage-CAePoYgl.js` has correct sandbox SDK URL + correct merchant pk, Revolut widget 403s are gone.
- [x] **Preserved old build chunks** alongside new ones (`cp -rn public/build.old/. public/build/`) so CSJ's in-flight incognito session survived the rebuild without a forced refresh — every route except `/checkout` continued to work mid-session.
- [x] **Incident log written** at `April/April23Updates/revolutCSPIncident.md` + mirrored to vault. Documents timeline, root causes, fixes, and 5 rules for next session (chief rule: warn CSJ before rebuilding during active browser testing).

### Outstanding from 65b

- [ ] **Complete the in-flight checkout test** — CSJ's original session has the pre-fix `CheckoutPage-Dq2ZEZzV.js` in memory with the wrong pk. Needs a fresh incognito window to exercise the correct `CheckoutPage-CAePoYgl.js` chunk and confirm the full sandbox checkout flow works end-to-end.
- [ ] **Clean up `public/build.old/` and `public/build.old2/`** on the dev server once ~24h have passed and no one is on a pre-rebuild session. `rm -rf` both.
- [ ] **Before the next `dev → main` PR**, verify `deploy/fynla-org/build.sh` and production `.env` have the LIVE Revolut pk (not sandbox) baked in / present, so a future production rebuild from a developer's laptop doesn't accidentally ship a sandbox-pk build to prod.

## Session 65 (23 April afternoon) — PR triage + dev deploy + intervention/image v3 downgrade

### Completed This Session

#### Repository + branch protection
- [x] **Re-enabled branch protection on `dev`** — 1 required PR review, code-owner review required (CODEOWNERS pins `@Stoff73`), dismiss stale reviews, required conversation resolution, no force pushes, no deletions. `enforce_admins: false` retained so CSJ can admin-bypass when needed.
- [x] **Re-enabled branch protection on `main`** — identical settings to dev. Previously unprotected, which contradicted CLAUDE.md's documented workflow.
- [x] **Saved new durable rule** in memory (`feedback_main_via_dev_only.md`): nothing merges to main without first being committed to dev, deployed to csjones.co/fynla, and browser-tested. Only CSJ overrides with explicit words in the current turn. MEMORY.md index updated.

#### PR triage (5 PRs processed)
- [x] **PR #213 closed** — stale session 52 CSJTODO doc, superseded by later handovers.
- [x] **PR #212 re-targeted** from `main` → `dev` (violated the new rule by targeting main directly).
- [x] **PR #221 rebased** onto the refreshed `dev` — CSJTODO conflict resolved by taking dev's newer version; force-pushed; admin-merged via `gh pr merge 221 --merge --admin`. Campaign pages + ReviewCarousel + StaticFynChat + 404 page now on dev.
- [x] **PR #223 opened + admin-merged** (`main → dev` back-merge) — brought session 64's subscription hotfix + session 63/64 handover docs onto dev. Dev was missing 3 commits (`ad73bd0`, `5cd5d62`, `bd9042e`) that had been admin-merged directly to main. Clean merge — only `AppLayout.vue` overlapped and auto-merged.
- [x] **PR #212 rebased** onto new `dev` through 40+ commits, 6 conflict points resolved manually (CSJTODO, CLAUDE.md, trial-expiration-reminder.blade.php, routes/web.php twice, AppLayout.vue three times, router/index.js, Settings.vue deletion). Force-pushed and admin-merged. Full lifecycle email engine (5 campaigns + engine + E2E test commands + magic-link routes + NotificationPreferences page + 14 toggles) now on dev.
- [x] **PR #224 opened + admin-merged** — downgraded `intervention/image ^4.0 → ^3.0` to keep PHP 8.2 compatibility, ported `InsightImageService` to the 3.11 API (`ImageManager::gd()`, `->read()`, `->toWebp(quality:)`). 9/9 existing tests still pass.

#### Dev server redeploy (csjones.co/fynla) — 167 files uploaded, 7 deleted, 12 migrations ran
- [x] **Server state probed via SSH** — confirmed server was at approximately `origin/onboardingFyn` state (last migration `2026_04_15_153100`), not main. Real delta was 173 files not the 153 my original guide assumed.
- [x] **`filesUploaded.md` comprehensive checklist** generated and mirrored to repo + vault. 215 line items across §A upload / §B delete / §C exclusions / §D server commands / §E smoke tests / §F rollback.
- [x] **167 files uploaded** via tar-pipe in 0.3s; hash-verified byte-for-byte match against `origin/dev`.
- [x] **7 superseded files deleted** on server (OnboardingChatDirector, OnboardingPromptBuilder, OnboardingStateMachine, OnboardingValueInterpreter, SpouseLinkingService, EmptyDataGuard, config/onboarding.php). 2 items in delete list were already absent.
- [x] **composer install** — resolved to `intervention/image 3.11.7` + `intervention/gif 4.2.4`, both PHP 8.2 compatible. Platform-check re-enabled and passing.
- [x] **Appended `.env` vars**: `LIFECYCLE_ENGINE_ENABLED=true` + `LIFECYCLE_TEST_RECIPIENT=chris@fynla.org`. Deduped after a session confusion created doubles. `.env.backup-2026-04-23-post-lifecycle` preserved.
- [x] **12 pending migrations ran** — 7 lifecycle + 5 insights, all `DONE`.
- [x] **Cache clears + optimize** — config + routes cached.
- [x] **Insights seeder** — 8 bespoke articles seeded.
- [x] **Full `php artisan db:seed --force`** — 22 seeders all green, including **OccupationCode (406 codes)**, Preview users (6 personas), ChrisUser, AdvisorClient, etc.
- [x] **Lifecycle engine smoke test** — `php artisan lifecycle:run-daily` ran all 5 campaigns cleanly (0 eligible users, as expected).
- [x] **Endpoint smoke tests** — `/fynla/`, `/fynla/pricing`, `/fynla/quickstart`, `/fynla/insights`, `/fynla/how-it-works`, `/fynla/features`, bad-URL SPA fallthrough → all HTTP 200.

#### Landing page CTA
- [x] **Unhid "Quick start with Fyn" CTA** on the landing page hero — commit `97edb5d` admin-pushed to dev. The HTML comment markers were removed; the `<router-link to="/register?from=fyn">` now renders live on both localhost:8000 and csjones.co/fynla. Known caveat: new-user Fyn flow has bugs (per `April/April9Updates/fynQuickStartBugs.md`) — CTA-to-flow fixes deferred to a future session.

#### Supporting docs (all mirrored to repo + vault)
- [x] `April/April23Updates/devUpdateDeploy.md` — initial deploy guide (subsequently superseded by filesUploaded.md when server state turned out to be further behind than main).
- [x] `April/April23Updates/filesUploaded.md` — authoritative 215-item upload + server-command checklist; all §A/§B/§D items (except optional §B4 renames + cron verification) ticked.
- [x] MEMORY.md index updated with new project memory for PR #214 coupling with `feature/fyn-persona-split`, and new feedback rule for main-via-dev-only workflow.

### NOT Done — Outstanding from Session 65

- [ ] **Browser smoke-test PR #221 features** end-to-end on csjones.co/fynla dev — 14 items listed in `filesUploaded.md` §E. This is the next-session opening task. Tech stack to exercise: `/quickstart`, QuickStart CTA (newly unhidden), ReviewCarousel on pricing/features/how-it-works, NotFoundPage fall-through, `/profile/notifications` toggles, lifecycle magic-link → discount prefill, admin insights image upload (tests intervention/image 3.11.7 port).
- [ ] **Fix Fyn quickstart bugs** — see `April/April9Updates/fynQuickStartBugs.md`. CTA is now live on dev but clicks route to `/register?from=fyn` which hits the known-buggy new-user Fyn flow. User explicitly deferred this to a later session.
- [ ] **Verify SG Site Tools crontab** — `crontab -l` via SSH returns empty, yet existing daily jobs (`trials:send-reminders`, `trials:expire`, etc.) clearly run on dev. SiteGround manages cron via their Site Tools web UI. Check that `* * * * * php artisan schedule:run` is configured for csjones.co; if not, the 08:30 UTC daily lifecycle job will silently never fire.
- [ ] **Test lifecycle engine end-to-end** with real emails — `php artisan lifecycle:e2e-test` seeds 5 test users and runs all campaigns against them, sending to `chris@fynla.org` (the LIFECYCLE_TEST_RECIPIENT override). Then `php artisan lifecycle:e2e-cleanup` removes them. Verifies magic-link routes, WebP hero rendering, discount code generation, restart-trial handler, feedback capture.
- [ ] **Optional §B4 cleanup** on server — delete the 7 stale Vue source files on the server (`Navbar.vue`, `Footer.vue`, `Holdings.vue`, `Performance.vue`, `Recommendations.vue`, dead `Goals.vue`, dead `UserProfile/Settings.vue`). Purely cosmetic — build output doesn't reference them.

### Context for Next Session

Dev branch is fully in sync with csjones.co/fynla server. Working tree is clean. Local dev server was running at end of session on Laravel :8000 + Vite :5173 — may still be up or may have been shut down. The big next-session task is browser-testing all the deployed PR #221/#212 features on the dev server, specifically the ones newly visible via the unhidden QuickStart CTA. After dev is stable and browser-tested, the next PR pipeline is `dev → main` for production rollout — but that must include #224's intervention/image downgrade or production will 500 on first composer install.

## Outstanding — Tech Debt Deferred (from earlier sessions)

- [ ] **Session 63 tech-debt branch** — already merged to dev (via PR #220) but still needs browser-test matrix before `dev → main`. 8 flows in `April/April18Updates/handover-tech-debt.md §4a`: Estate/IHT dashboard, Investment (holdings/fees/tax/rebalance), Protection, Expenditure form penny-level totals, Estate CRUD, Net worth, Savings, Investment detail.
- [ ] **28 Vue god components** (>800 lines) — prioritise `Admin/TaxSettings.vue` (3,068 lines) and `UserProfile/ExpenditureForm.vue` (2,574 lines). Multi-week effort.
- [ ] **13 backend god files** — `SavingsActionDefinitionService.php` (3,686 lines), `RetirementActionDefinitionService.php` (2,701), `ProtectionActionDefinitionService.php` (2,349), `RetirementIncomeService.php` (2,292), `IHTCalculationService.php` (1,641).
- [ ] **54 controllers using inline `$request->validate()`** — convert to Form Request classes (~60-80h total).
- [ ] **npm `--force` fix** — schedule a 2-4h window for vite 8 + `@capacitor/cli` 8 major upgrades with full PWA + iOS + web regression. 6 high-severity vulnerabilities remain until done. Carried from session 63.
- [ ] **Test Fyn chat fixes on dev (csjones.co/fynla)** — deployed in session 58 but not browser-tested. Carried from session 58.
- [ ] **Add `Current State/Insights.md`** to the vault — carried from session 62.
- [ ] **`AutoRiskCalculatorTest` pre-existing failure** — `risk_level` enum truncation. Pre-existing since 16 April.

## Known Issues

- **CLAUDE.md stale tax-year claim** — says `active: 2025/26` but the seeded `TaxConfiguration` table correctly has `2026/27` active (which is right — 2026/27 started 6 April 2026). `TaxConfigService` reads from DB so behaviour is correct; the line in CLAUDE.md just wants a one-character update.
- **Build script deploy-path echo** is outdated — `./deploy/csjones-fynla/build.sh` prints `~/www/csjones.co/public_html/fynla/public/build/` but the actual sibling-dir path is `~/www/csjones.co/fynla-app/public/build/`. Cosmetic.
- **Dev server user crontab empty** — see "Outstanding — verify SG Site Tools crontab" above.

## Deploy Status

- **fynla.org (production)** — unchanged from session 64. `ad73bd0` subscription hotfix live. Test user `bugrepro_expired_2026_04_23@fynla.org` still in grace-period state.
- **csjones.co/fynla (dev)** — fully in sync with dev branch tip `97edb5d`. All four merged PRs (#212, #220, #221, #223) plus session 65's CTA unhide deployed. composer, .env, migrations, seeds, caches all current.
- **Pending production deploy** — `dev → main` PR not opened. Must include PR #224 (intervention/image v3) or production will 500 on first composer install due to PHP 8.3 requirement. Don't open the `dev → main` PR until session 65's browser testing is complete and any uncovered issues are fixed.
- **Open PRs remaining:** #214 (`onboardingFyn` → `dev`) — still CONFLICTING, coupled with `feature/fyn-persona-split` per memory. Do NOT rebase/merge in isolation.

## Active Work Not Carried by PR

- **Local dev server:** running at `http://localhost:8000/` + Vite `:5173` as of end of session. Check with `lsof -i :8000` before relying on it next session.
- **SSH key:** `~/.ssh/fynlaDev` was loaded into the agent this session (`ssh-add`). It'll remain loaded until the agent cache expires or the machine is rebooted.
